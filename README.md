I have never worked in Apple、Google、Microsoft or even Alibaba. I have never been engaged in iOS、macOS or reverse engineering. Now I am committed to Android applications and hybrid development. I am not an expert in professional compilers, but just a senior CV engineer.

### I am a senior CV engineer.
我既没有在苹果谷歌微软工作过，甚至都没有在阿里巴巴工作过，从未从事iOS、macOS和逆向工程，现在我致力于Android应用以及混合开发开发，我不是专业编译器的专家，仅仅是一个高级CV工程师而已。
