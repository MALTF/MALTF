I have never worked at Apple, Google, Microsoft, or even Alibaba, and have never been engaged in iOS, MacOS, or reverse engineering. Now, I am dedicated to Android applications and hybrid development. I am not an expert in professional compilers, but a senior CV engineer.

### I am a senior CV engineer.
我既没有在苹果谷歌微软工作过，甚至都没有在阿里巴巴工作过，从未从事iOS、macOS和逆向工程，现在我致力于Android应用以及混合开发开发，我不是专业编译器的专家，只是一个高级CV工程师而已。
